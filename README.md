# Object Classification
Object classification using classical machine learning methods

This project solves an object recognition task. Each object is represented by a 28x28 dimensional image in a single 'flattened' 784 dimensional vector with an associated label (+1 or -1). The training data (with labels) and test data (without labels) are in the files Xtest and Xtrain and the training lables in Ytrain
